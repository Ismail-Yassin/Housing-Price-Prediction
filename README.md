# Introduction
This project is a personal project and the data from this project was obtained from Kaggle called the housing price prediction. It involves the making a model to to predict the house prices. It doesn't go up to detail of its deployment but this are the first steps in my machine learning journey to showcase my growth in this industry. I believe I am in the right place to learn Machine learning and AI, together with data data analysis. Github provides a perfect platform torecord and also track my progress.

# Background
The data was obtained from Kaggle and it is a competition. The data is about the housing prices in the United States. The data is divided into two parts, the training data and the test data. The training data contains the features and the target variable. The test data contains the features only. The goal is to predict the house prices in the test data. The data contains 79 features and 1 target variable. The target variable is the sale price of the house. The features are the characteristics of the house. The data is in a csv format. The data is clean and does not contain any missing values

# Tools used
The tools used in this project are:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
-sci-kit learn
# Analysis
The analysis was done in the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation

Here is a visual representation of the pipeline and code:

# What I Learned
In this project, I learned the follwing and I am going to build on it in the future:
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
# Challenges
These are some of the challenges I faced and what I need to improve on:
- Building a pipeline to automatically preprocess the data is still a challenge
- Building a model that performs well is still a challenge
# Insights
These are some of the insights I got from the data:
- The features I chose to build the model are important in predicting the house prices and I did not need to use all the features in the data
- I build three models and I chose the second the one because it had the best performance with least mean squared error.
# Conclusion 
This project was a great learning experience for me and I am looking forward to building more models in the future. I am looking forward to learning more about machine learning and AI. I am looking forward to learning more about data analysis and data visualization. I am looking forward to learning more about data preprocessing and feature engineering.
