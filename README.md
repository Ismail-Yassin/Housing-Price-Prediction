# Introduction
This project is a personal project and the data from this project was obtained from Kaggle called the housing price prediction. It involves the making a model to to predict the house prices. It doesn't go up to detail of its deployment but this are the first steps in my machine learning journey to showcase my growth in this industry. I believe I am in the right place to learn Machine learning and AI, together with data data analysis. Github provides a perfect platform torecord and also track my progress.
